1. Write a program to take the principal amount, rate of interest, and time from 
the user and calculate the simple interest.
• Formula: Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100.

2. Take a temperature in Celsius as input from the user and convert it to 
Fahrenheit using the formula:
• Formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32.

3. Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and 
calculates its area and perimeter.
• Formula:
Area = length × width
Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

4. Write a Python program to take a character as input from the user and print 
its ASCII value.

5. Take the radius of a circle from the user and calculate the area and 
circumference.
• Formula:
Area = π × radius²
Circumference = 2 × π × radius

6. Take two numbers as input from the user and swap their values without using 
a third variable.

7. Write a Python program to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation. The 
quadratic equation has the form ax2+bx+c=0ax^2 + bx + c = 0ax2+bx+c=0. You 
will take input values for aaa, bbb, and ccc from the user. The roots can be 
calculated using the formula: 
• D=b2−4acD = b^2 - 4acD=b2−4ac
• Root 1 = −b+D2a\frac{-b + \sqrt{D}}{2a}2a−b+D
• Root 2 = −b−D2a\frac{-b - \sqrt{D}}{2a}2a−b−D

8. Write a Python program to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI). Take the user's 
weight (in kg) and height (in meters) as input.
• Formula: BMI = weight / (height × height)
